          Anfy Lake - Copyright (C) by Fabio Ciucci 1998-2002


This applet can generate a reflection effect under any GIF or JPG image.
It is very similiar to the Lake and DorianGray applets made by other authors,
but this one has a different approach. Since it it calculated in realtime,
it requires less memory (about 10 times less!).

This applet is fully parametrized, so you can generate many kinds of lake
effects.

NECESSARY FILES.

As well as an image to be animated and an optional overlay image, the 
following 3 ".class" files must be uploaded: 

AnLake.class  
Lware.class
anfy class

Plus, AnLake.jar for speedy loading on recent browsers.

EXAMPLE.

Insert the <applet> tag in your html document as follows to add this applet
to your page (Comments after the ";" symbol are code explanations and
acceptable min/max values. They are not part of the applet language):

INSTRUCTIONS.

The following instructions describe how to change parameters:

Note: attempting to alter the "credits" parameter will disable the applet.

To activate the "reg" parameters read the shareware registration notes.
In the "regcode" parameter, place the registration code you purchased 
from the author. If the code is correct and the applet is run from
the registered domain name, you can use "link" parameters to link to a URL
when the applet is "clicked".

If you set "regnewframe" to "YES", you can specify a specific frame location
for the reglink:

"_blank"  : To load the link in a new blank unnamed browser window.
"_self"   : To load the link into the same window the applet occupies.
"_parent" : To load the link into the immediate FRAMESET parent.
"_top"    : To load the link into the top body of the window.

You can also set a custom frame name, such as "myframe1".

With the "overimg" parameter you can specify the name of an image that will
be painted over the applet. The best options are transparent GIF images.
NOTE: Animated GIF images are supported, but will be displayed as animated
sequence only on latest browsers (Netscape 4 and Explorer 4 or newer).
With "overimgX" and "overimgY" you can center the image over the applet area.

The GIF/JPG image can be of any size. The applet size must be the same width
as the image, and double in height. For example,if the image is 160x100, the
applet size must be 160x200.

Instead, if "halfreflect" parameter="YES", the size of applet has to be set to
160x150, in other words 3/2 of original size (original size * 1.5).

If res=1, remember to place the exact size of the image in "width" and "height"
tags, with height multiplied by 2 (or by 1.5 if halfreflect="YES").
If res=2, place doubled values of width and quadrupled of height, if res=3
triple values of width, sit times the height, etc.
(The "res" parameter is a sort of zoomer).

The "wavspeed" parameter (values from 1 to 200) allows you to determine the
speed of waving.

With "perspective" parameter (values from 1 to 100), you decide how the waves
have to be stretched for perspective simulation.

The "farwaving" parameter (values from 1 to 10000) allows you to determine
how strong the far waves (top of lake) must be.

With "wind" parameter (values from 1 to 20), you decide how strong the waving
will be.

Optionally, you can make the wind dynamically change, setting the
parameter "windvarval" as higher than 0 (higher values mean higher change).
Then, with the parameters "windvarmin" and "windvarmax" you can control the
min and max values of wind reached.

Usually, the reflected area is same size of the normal display area.
If you want, you can change this ratio, setting "halfreflect" to "YES".
The reflect area then will become half size of original image, but remember
to make applet height size = original imagesize * 1.5 , instead of * 2.
