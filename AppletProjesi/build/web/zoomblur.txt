          Zoom Blur Applet - Copyright (C) Anfy Team 2000-2002


This applet displays a scrolling text, using coloured fonts.
The text can scroll horizontally, vertically or with a circular move.
You can add Blur or/and Zoom effect, and also stars using Anfy Font.
This applet contains code by Kevin LEVRON, used under a licence.

The coloured fonts are in AFT (Anfy Font) format.
You can create your own aft fonts using a paint program, otherwise
download freely the AFT fonts collection from here:

INSTRUCTIONS.

The following instructions describe how to change parameters:

Attempting to change the credits parameter will disable the applet.

To activate the reg parameters, please read the shareware registration notes.
In the "regcode" parameter, place the registration code you purchased from
the author. If the code is correct and the applet is run from the registered
domain name, you can use "link" parameters to link to a URL when the applet 
is "clicked".

If you set "regnewframe" to "YES", you can specify a specific frame location
for the reglink:

"_blank"  : To load the link in a new blank unnamed browser window.
"_self"   : To load the link into the same window the applet occupies.
"_parent" : To load the link into the immediate FRAMESET parent.
"_top"    : To load the link into the top body of the window.

You can also set a custom frame name, such as "myframe1".

Applet size is determined by "res": "res=1" shows the graphic at original size,
"res=2" shows it at double size, etc.
So, If res=1, remember to place the exact size of image in "width" and "height" tags.
If res=2, place double values, if res=3 place triple values etc. (In fact, res is
a sort of zoomer).

With the "statusmsg" parameter you can set a message which appear at the bottom
of the browser window, when you mouse-over the applet. Enter any message here.

With the "overimg" parameter you can specify the name of an image that will
be painted over the applet. The best options are transparent GIF images.

NOTE: Animated GIF images are supported, but will be animated only on latest
browsers (Netscape 4 and Explorer 4 or newer).

With "overimgX" and "overimgY" you can center the image over the applet area.

The size of the applet is determined by width and height tags.

With "font" parameter you can specify the AnfyFont file name (the .aft file).

With "text" parameter you can specify the text file name.

Note: Only characters present in the AFT font will be displayed.
If the AFT font does not contain numbers, or special characters, those will 
be simply ignored.

With "bgcolor" you can set the background color in RGB hex value, like html
format, but without the prefix "#". Default value is "000000" (black).
Please note, this parameter will have effect only if zbmode="no".
In fact, with other modes the blur effect is activated and the background
will be black, since the blur fades to black.

With "blur" parameter you can set the blur value (1..255), which is the
color component subtracted for each level of blur to reach the black of
the background.
Lower values gives soft and more propagated blurring, higher values gives
stronger decadence of color, fading to black sooner.

With "displaymode" parameter you specify the text display mode:
The "normal" value will draw replacing colors.
The "over" will draw adding colors to what's on background (mixing).

With "texthspace" parameter you specify the horizontal space between letters.

With the "zbmode" parameter you can specify the ZoomBlur mode:
"normal" = zoom & blur
"noblur" = no blur effect
"nozoom" = no zoom effect
"no" = no zoom effect, no blur

With the "zbcoef" parameter you can specify the Zoom levels distance coefficient,
with values from 1 to 100. Lower values make the blur levels more distant, higher
values make the blur levels nearer.

With the "zbmove" parameter you can specify the Zoom blur movements.
You can choose between "no", "circle", "random".

If zbmove="no", you can specify the center of zoom with "dx" and "dy"
parameters. The center of applet is equal to "0", and you can place
positive or negative values to change the center of zooming.

With the "txtmove" parameter you can specify the text scrolling mode,
choosing from the values: "no" (no scrolling), "horizontal", "vertical"
and "ellipse".

If the "txtmove" is set to "no" or "ellipse", the texts are displayed
line by line, and the "delay" and "delay1" parameters are activated to
calibrate the timing of lines swapping:

With "delay" parameter you specify the number of frames to wait between
switch the text strings displayed.

With "delay1" you specify the number of frames the text is displayed.
Place here a value lower than "delay" to make the text disappear for a
while between the text-lines swap.

If the "txtmove" is set to "ellipse", you can also set the horizontal and
vertical radius, repectively using the "rx" and "ry" parameters.

If the "txtmove" is set to "horizontal" or "vertical", the text is scrolled
continuously, at a speed choosen with the "speed" parameter.
The "speed" parameter can be either negative or positive in order to get
the different scrolling directions and speed.
For left to right, or up to down scrolling set speed > 0.
For right to left, or down to up scrolling set speed < 0.
To calibrate speed, consider speed="8" scrolls 1 pixel per frame.
In txtmove=horizontal case, it's suggested to use negative values, in
order to scroll the text from right to left <-, even if it's possible to
use positive values to have a strange scroller.
To specify negative values use the "-" minus sign, for example: "-8".

With the "nbstars" parameter you can set the stars number.
Specify "0" for no stars.

With the "star" parameter you can set the string wich represent stars.
This string will be draw with corresponding Anfy Font. It's suggested
to specify one only character, for example "*", "-", or a character
which in the selected font have a nice image.
However, you can also choose to use a string like "ANFY" as star.

With the "stardisplaymode" parameter you can specify the way to
draw the stars. Set it to "normal" to replace colors, or "over"
to add colors over the existing background (mising).

THE AFT FORMAT SPECIFICATIONS

If you are interested in creating new fonts for your personal use, or
to add those to the freely usable AFT fonts collection, you should
know how the AFT format works.

An AFT font comprises 2 files, with a single prefix + different suffixes,
for example:

myfont.aft
myfont.gif

The .aft file is an ascii text file, editable by hand, and the gif file
is an image file editable with any paint program.

Both files must have the same prefix, and the suffixes should be in 
lowercase.

Here an example of .aft:


myfont
32
23
0
 !#%%%%'()%%,-./0123456789:;%=%?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ%
This is a comment... hello...


The 1st line contains the name of the gif file, without .gif suffix.
The 2nd line contains the font width.
The 3rd line contains the font height.
The 4th line contains the Y spacing between characters.
The 5th line contains the characters index (its order in GIF image)

For example, if a font is painted as:

ABCDE
FGHIJ
KLMNO

The fontindex will be: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO

But, if a font is painted as:

AEIMQUY
BFJNRVZ
CGKOSW!
DHLPTX#

The fontindex will be: AEIMQUYBFJNRVZCGKOSW!DHLPTX#

Note: the background of the gif image must be black (000000 in hex), and the
black must be present only in the background, otherwise the background
colour changes a function in the scroller applet and this will cause problems.
