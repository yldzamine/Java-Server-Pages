A NEW APPLET

It is a period
of civil war. 
Rebel applets,
striking  from
a hidden site,
have won their
first victory
against the evil
Web Empire.

During   the
battle,   Rebel
spies managed
to steal secret
plans  to  the
Empire's ultimate
weapon,   the
DEATH APPLET,
an armored web
station  with
enough power to
destroy   an 
entire   site.
